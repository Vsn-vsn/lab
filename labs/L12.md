# Best First Search

## Algo
1. Initialize: Start with an open list (priority queue) containing the initial state.
2. Expand the best node: Pick the node with the lowest heuristic value (i.e., the most promising one).
3. Generate successors: Expand the chosen node and add its successors to the queue.
4. Sort by heuristic: Sort the queue based on the heuristic function.
5. Repeat until the goal is found or the queue becomes empty.
