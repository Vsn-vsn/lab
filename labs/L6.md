## Q1

```python
import random

# Define the function to maximize
def f(x):
    return x**2 - 5*x + 6   # Example function: A quadratic function

# Hill Climbing Algorithm
def hill_climb(start_x=None, step_size=0.1, max_iterations=1000, x_bounds=(-10, 10)):
    # Randomly initialize x if not provided
    if start_x is None:
        x = random.uniform(x_bounds[0], x_bounds[1])
    else:
        x = start_x
    
    for _ in range(max_iterations):
        # Generate small perturbations (neighbors)
        neighbors = [x + step_size, x - step_size]
        
        # Ensure neighbors are within bounds
        neighbors = [max(min(neighbor, x_bounds[1]), x_bounds[0]) for neighbor in neighbors]

        # Choose the neighbor with the highest function value
        best_x = max(neighbors, key=f)

        # If no improvement, terminate
        if f(best_x) <= f(x):
            break
        
        # Move to the better neighbor
        x = best_x
    
    return x, f(x)

# Run the hill climbing algorithm
best_x, max_value = hill_climb()

print(f"Maximum value of f(x) is {max_value} at x = {best_x}")

```

## Q2
1) State Representation: A list of size 8, where index represents a column and the value at that index represents the row of the queen in that column.

Example: [0, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 7]
2) Heuristic Function: Number of attacking queen pairs (lower is better).

3) Hill Climbing Steps:

    * Start with a random board configuration.
    * Compute the heuristic (number of attacks).
    * Try small changes (moving a queen in its column).
    * Choose the move that reduces attacks the most.
    * Repeat until no improvement is possible.

```python
import random

# Define the board size
N = 8

# Function to calculate the number of attacking pairs
def calculate_attacks(board):
    attacks = 0
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(i + 1, N):
            if board[i] == board[j] or abs(board[i] - board[j]) == abs(i - j):
                attacks += 1
    return attacks

# Hill Climbing Algorithm for 8-Queens
def hill_climb_8queens():
    # Step 1: Start with a random state (random row for each column)
    board = [random.randint(0, N - 1) for _ in range(N)]
    
    while True:
        current_attacks = calculate_attacks(board)

        # If no attacks, solution found
        if current_attacks == 0:
            return board
        
        best_move = None
        best_attacks = current_attacks

        # Step 2: Try moving each queen in its column and find the best move
        for col in range(N):
            original_row = board[col]  # Save original position
            for row in range(N):
                if board[col] == row:
                    continue  # Skip current position
                
                board[col] = row  # Move queen
                new_attacks = calculate_attacks(board)
                
                # If we found a better move, save it
                if new_attacks < best_attacks:
                    best_attacks = new_attacks
                    best_move = (col, row)
            
            board[col] = original_row  # Restore original position
        
        # Step 3: If no improvement, return the best state found
        if best_move is None:
            return board

        # Step 4: Apply the best move found
        board[best_move[0]] = best_move[1]

# Run the algorithm
solution = hill_climb_8queens()
print("Solution Board:", solution)
